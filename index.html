            <h3>General</h3>
            <hr class="middle-container-hr-1">
            <p><span>Adventism</span> is a branch of Protestant Christianity that believes in the imminent Second Coming (or the "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ.
            It originated in the 1830s in the United States during the Second Great Awakening when Baptist preacher William Miller first publicly shared his belief
            that the Second Coming would occur at some point between 1843 and 1844.
            His followers became known as Millerites.After Miller's prophecies failed,the Millerite movement split up and was continued by a number of groups
            that held different doctrines from one another.
            These groups,stemming from a common Millerite ancestor,became known collectively as the Adventist movement.</p>
            <p>Although the Adventist churches hold much in common with mainline Christianity,their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state of the dead is unconscious sleep
            or consciousness,whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment,the nature of immortality,whether the wicked are resurrected after the millennium,
            and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in heaven or one on earth.
            The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible,leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the seventh day Sabbath.
            The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005),which use biblical references as justification.</p>
            <p>In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches.
            The largest church within the movement—the Seventh-day Adventist Church—had more than 21 million members in 2020.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <hr class="middle-container-hr-2">
            <p>Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement.Its most vocal leader was William Miller.
            Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return.
            After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844,many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.
            Of those remaining Adventist,the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date,
            yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of Jesus).</p>
            <p>Of those who retained the October 22 date,many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually",and consequently were known as "spiritualizers".
            A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22,but that this event had been misinterpreted.
            This belief later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church,the largest remaining body today.</p>
            <h3>Big disappointment</h3>
            <hr class="middle-container-hr-3"> 
            <p>In 1844, the movement was called Advent.Then EVERYONE was waiting for Jesus.The church as a church,comes later!
            If there had not been a "great disappointment",that is,if they had had the light about what would happen in 1844,then the news would not have resonated so much in the world,
            there would not have been a commotion in the nations,the SDA movement would not have developed so strongly,people wouldn't have talked so much about it and were familiar with it.
            What would people say:"every advertisement is a good advertisement",and the Lord knows that and His providence is perfect!</p>
            <p>And it was also a test for true believers:"It was this bitter disappointment that came upon the little flock whose faith was so strong and their hope so high.
            However,we were surprised that we felt freedom in the Lord,and that we were so strongly surrounded by His strength and grace.
            We were disappointed,but not brokenhearted.</p>
            <p>By the way,the experience of the Adventist pioneers (here we do not mean today's ASD) was the biblical gift of prophecy,
            as stated in Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 19:10 which describe the testimony of Jesus as "the spirit of prophecy".</p>
            <p>The faithful remnant of the end times of human history keep the commandments of God and have the TESTIMONY of Jesus Christ. (Revelation 12:17)
            What is the testimony of Jesus Christ?It is the spirit of prophecy. (Revelation 19:10)</p>
            <p>Every biblical prophet has a testimony of Jesus Christ, ie. the spirit of prophecy, like the apostle John, for example:
            "Who bear witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,and whatever they see.
            Blessed is he that readeth,and they that hear the words of the prophecy,and keep what is written therein;for the time is near." (Revelation 1:2-3)</p>
            <p>We see that every significant period in history has its own prophet sent by God (Moses, Isaiah, Daniel,John...),let alone the last time of human history.
            This is what Jesus was talking about,because he said that there will be many false prophets,
            which automatically means that there will be the real one who needs to be recognized:"And many false prophets shall arise,and shall deceive many." (Matthew 24:11)</p>
            <p>Therefore,the TESTIMONY of Jesus Christ for the last time,is the testimony of the prophet of the last time whom God sends! Who is this prophet?</p>
            <p>That prophet:Lives and prophesies at the beginning of the last time,it carries end-time messages,teaches about the importance of keeping the 10 commandments of God,
            reveals who the beast of Revelation is,reveals and speaks of the mark of the beast,he gives answers to the real temptations of people before the end of the world,
            the most accusations will be made against him,everything he prophesied is coming true!</p>
